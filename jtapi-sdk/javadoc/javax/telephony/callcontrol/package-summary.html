<H1>
Java Telephony API
- Call Control Extension Package
</H1>

<H2>
Introduction
</H2>

<P>
This document provides an overview of the Call Control Extension Package to
the Java Telephony API. The Call Control Package extends the Core API by
providing more advanced features and more detailed information about the
call model. The more advanced features take the form of additional methods
on the call control objects: Call, Connection, Terminal, Address, and
TerminalConnection. The Call Control Package provides more detailed information
about the call model, using an extended set of states on the Connection
and TerminalConnection objects.
</P>

<OL>
<LI><A HREF="#METHODS">Call Control Package Methods</A>
This section briefly summarizes the methods and features made available by
the Call Control Package. It provides this summary for each of the interfaces
in this package.
<BR><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#STATES">Call Control Package Extended
States</A> The detailed set of states available in the Call Control
Package are described in this section of the overview. The Call Control
Package extends both the core Connection states and the core TerminalConnection
states.
<BR><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#CONNECT">Object and State Diagram for
the telephone calls</A> Similar to the presentation of the timeline
of objects and states for the Call.connect() method in the overview document
for the core API, this section presents an analysis of what applications might
expect to see in terms of objects and their states when a telephone call is
placed. It gives the most accurate and clearest view of when certain objects
are created and their likely state transitions.
<BR><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#OUTCALL">OutCall.java Code Example</A>
This section provides a code example of an application that places an
outgoing telephone call. Although it invokes Call.connect(), a core method,
it monitors the advanced states associated with the Call Control Package.
<BR><BR>
<LI><A HREF="#INCALL">InCall.java Code Example</A>
This section provides a code example of answering a telephone call incoming
to a Terminal. This example shows how an application uses the accept(),
reject(), or redirect() methods in addition to the core
TerminalConnection.answer() method.
</OL>


<H2>
<A NAME="METHODS">Call Control Package Methods</A>
</H2>

<P>
This section outlines, for each interface defined in the Call Control Package,
the methods and features provided. It is meant to provide a general overview
of the additional features of each object, allowing application developers to
ascertain whether the Call Control Package satisfies their requirements.
</P>

<H3>
The CallControlCall Interface
</H3>

<P>
The CallControlCall interfaces provides additional methods extending the
core Call interface. The primary methods this extension interface provides
are: conference(), transfer(), drop(), and consult(). This conference()
method, as commonly known, conferences two calls together into a single
call. When conference() returns control to the application, 
all of the parties on each of the two individual calls
are connected to one another. The transfer() method moves the parties of
one call to another call, where one party typically drops off of the call.
The drop() method provides a convenience functionality for the core
disconnect()
method located on Connections. The drop() method drops the entire call
rather than an individual Connection. The consult() method begins a
consultation call from an existing call. Applications perform the consult()
action in order to eventually conference() or transfer() the two calls.
</P>



<H3>
The CallControlAddress Interface
</H3>

<P>
The CallControlAddress interface provides additional methods extending the
core Address interface. The primary methods this extension interface provides
are: setForwarding(), setDoNotDisturb(), and setMessageWaiting(). These
methods do not pertain to an existing call, rather they provide instructions
to the Provider pertaining to the designated Address. The setForwarding()
method instructs the switch to forward all incoming calls to that address
according to certain rules. The setDoNotDisturb() method instructs the switch
not to allow any incoming calls to that Address to alert at the Address. The
setMessageWaiting() method informs the switch that a message is waiting at
this address.
</P>


<H3>
The CallControlConnection Interface
</H3>

<P>
The CallControlConnection interface provides additional methods extending the
core Connection interface. The primary methods this extension interface
provides are: accept(), reject(), redirect(), and park(). The accept() method
accepts an incoming call offered to this Address, resulting in the call
alerting at the Address. Conversely, the reject() method rejects an incoming
call offered to this address. This rejected call never alerts at the Address
and dies. The redirect() method transfers an incoming call which is either
offered to an Address or already alerting at an Address to another Address.
The redirect() method is similar to the transfer() method on the 
CallControlCall interface, except the redirect() method is used on Connections
before they are connected and active in a call. The park() method "parks" a
Connection at a destination Address. "Parking" a Connection moves the Connection
from its current Address into a special "waiting" state on the destination
Address.
</P>

<H3>
The CallControlTerminal Interface
</H3>

<P>
The CallControlTerminal interface provides additional methods extending the
core Terminal interface. The primary method this extension interface provides
is the pickup() method. The pickup() method "picks up" a Connection from a
number of situations. Applications may use the pickup() method at a Terminal
for a Connection which was previously "parked". Applications may also use
the pickup() method to answer telephony calls which are not alerting at their
Terminal, but at a different Address entirely.
</P>


<H3>
The CallControlTerminalConnection Interface
</H3>

<P>
The CallControlTerminalConnection interface provides additional methods
extending the core TerminalConnection interface. The primary methods this
extension interface provides are: hold(), unhold(), join(), and leave(). The
hold() method, as commonly known, places a TerminalConnection on hold with
respect to the telephone call it is part of. The unhold() method takes a
TerminalConnection off hold and makes it active once again. The join() method
takes a TerminalConnection which is bridged in a telephone call and makes it
active. The leave() method takes an active TerminalConnection in a telephone
call and returns it to the bridged state.
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H2>
<A NAME="STATES">Call Control Package Extended States</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Call Control Package provides both additional features and
additional information about the current state
of telephone calls in the call model. This additional information takes the
form of an expanded set of states for the Connection and TerminalConnection
objects, above the set of states provided by the core package for each of
these objects. This expanded set of states allows the
implementation to describe more accurately to the application what is going
on in a telephone call. Most of the methods in the package rely upon
these expanded states.
</P>

<P>
If an application wants to use the Call Control Package, it is expected that
it will only monitor the states provided by the Call Control Package, and
not monitor the core states. In several cases, the Call Control Package
does not expand upon a state and uses the exact states as in the core with
the same meaning.
</P>

<P>
As mentioned above, the Call Control Package expands upon the states in the
core Connection and TerminalConnection objects. Listed below are the states
found in the CallControlConnection and CallControlTerminalConnection interfaces
that expand upon their respective core states. With each state is
a brief, real-world description of their meaning.
</P>

<H3>CallControlConnection States</H3>


IDLE state

<P>
The IDLE state carries the same meaning as the Connection's IDLE state. It is
the initial state for all Connections and is transitory in nature. Most
Connections do not stay in the IDLE state for long.
</P>

INITIATED state

<P>
The INITIATED state represents that an originating Connection is involved with
placing a telephone call, however the telephone corresponding to the
originating side has not been taken off-hook
yet.
</P>

DIALING state

<P>
The DIALING state represents that an origination
Connection is involved with placing a telephone call and has begun dialing the
digits of the destination address but has not yet completed.
</P>

ESTABLISHED

<P>
The ESTABLISHED state represents that a
Connection is actively part of a telephone call. This Connection's CONNECTED
state most closely corresponds to this state, however Connection's CONNECTED
is more general than ESTABLISHED.
</P>

OFFERED state

<P>
The OFFERED state indicates for a destination
Connection that a Call is being offered to an address. Typically, applications
either accept or reject this offered call.
</P>

QUEUED state

<P>
The QUEUED state indicates that a Connection
is waiting at an Address, however, is not actively part of a telephone call.
Applications may send a Connection to another Address in the
QUEUED state to wait to be picked up. Another example of
when Connections enter the QUEUED state is when the
destination is busy and a "queueing" feature is turned on allowing the incoming
Call to wait until the destination is no longer busy.
</P>

 
NETWORK_REACHED state

<P>
The NETWORK_REACHED state indicates that
a Call has reached the network on the destination end, however no confirmation
that the actual destination has been reached. This may be the last state reached
by a destination Connection and applications often treat this as if the
Connection is in the ESTABLISHED state.
</P>


NETWORK_ALERTING state

<P>
The NETWORK_ALERTING state indicates that a Connection which was previously in
the NETWORK_REACHED state is now alerting at the destination.
When the destination answers the telephone call, the Connection will move
into the ESTABLISHED state from this state.
</P>


ALERTING state

<P>
The ALERTING state has the same meaning as the
Connection's ALERTING state. It implies that a telephone call is alerting at
its destination.
</P>


DISCONNECTED state

<P>
The DISCONNECTED state has the same
meaning as the Connection's DISCONNECTED state. It implies that a Connection is
no longer active in a telephone call. It is the final state for Connections
in the Call Control Package as well as in the core.
</P>


FAILED state

<P>
The FAILED state has the same meaning as the
Connection's FAILED state. It implies that a Connection has failed for some
reason and is no longer able to perform additional actions in the Call.
</P>


UNKNOWN state
<P>
The UNKNOWN state has the same meaning as the
Connection's UNKNOWN state. It implies that the state of a Connection is not
known to the Provider as the application cannot take any action on this
Connection.
</P>

<BR>

<H3>State Transitions for the CallControlConnection Interface</H3>
<P>
In the overview of the core Connection states, a finite state machine
described the allowable transitions from one Connection state to the other.
This state diagram provides insight to the application developer on how
Connections may move from one state to another. The following diagram is
the analogous state diagram for the CallControlConnection states. Because
the CallControlConnection interface possesses more states than the core, the
state diagram is more complex. Applications that perform only
the simple tasks provided by the core need not concern themselves with this
more complicated set of states.
</P>
<P>
To make the state diagram more clear, the ESTABLISHED state has been
replicated three times. All of the transitions into the ESTABLISHED state
can be viewed as the union of all of the transitions into each separate
ESTABLISHED state below. Similarly, all of the transitions out of the
ESTABLISHED state can be viewed as the union of all of the transitions out
of each separate ESTABLISHED state below. The FAILED, DISCONNECTED, and
UNKNOWN states are unique because they have transitions into, and out of, virtually
every other state. The asterisk (*) next to the transition arrows denote
this. There are several exceptions, however. There are no transitions out
of the DISCONNECTED state and the IDLE state may not transition into the
DISCONNECTED state. All states may transition into the FAILED state except
for the DISCONNECTED state. Neither FAILED nor DISCONNECTED states may 
transition into the UNKNOWN state. Also, the FAILED state may transition only to the
DISCONNECTED.
</P>

         ALT="Call Control Connection States">

<BR>
<H3>Relationship between Connection and CallControlConnection States</H3>
<P>
In addition to the allowable transitions of Connection states in the Call
Control Package, the mapping of the Connection states to the
CallControlConnection states is important. This mapping implies that when
the CallControlConnection state is a certain states, it implies the
Connection state must be a certain state. Although applications should only
monitor one set of states, it is neccessary to provide this mapping to
maintain consistency.
</P>
<P>
The following chart describes the state of the Connection in the Call Control
Package (on the right) and the state of the Connection in the core package
(on the left). Note that applications may obtain the core Connection state
via the method Connection.getState() and applications may obtain the
Call Control Package Connection states via the
CallControlConnection.getCallControlState() method.

<H3>CallControlTerminalConnection States</H3>

IDLE state

<P>
The IDLE state has the same meaning as in the TerminalConnection. It is the
initial state for all CallControlTerminalConnection objects.
</P>


RINGING state

<P>
The RINGING state has the same meaning
as the TerminalConnection's RINGING state. It implies that a Terminal is ringing
because of an incoming telephone call.
</P>

BRIDGED state

<P>
The BRIDGED state indicates that a
Terminal is bridged into an active telephone call. Although the Terminal
is not actively part of the telephone call is may become so by joining the
call. Although not actively part of the telephone call, the resource
associated with this bridge on the Terminal is being used.
</P>


INUSE state

<P>
The INUSE state indicates that a
Terminal is not actively part of a call nor bridged into a call, but still
part of the telephone call. Although the Terminal cannot join the Call, the
resource on the Terminal associated with this Call is still being used.
</P>


TALKING state

<P>
The TALKING state indicates that a
Terminal is actively part of a telephone call. It is similar to the
TerminalConnection's TALKING state, however that state has a more general
definition. The TALKING state implies that
Terminal is talking on the telephone call versus being held.
</P>


HELD state

<P>
The HELD state indicates that a Terminal
is actively part of a telephone call, however it is currently on hold.
</P>


DROPPED state

<P>
The DROPPED state has the same meaning
as the TerminalConnection's DROPPED state. The Terminal was once part of a
telephone call but no longer is. As in the core, this state is the final
state for all TerminalConnections in the Call Control Package.
</P>


UNKNOWN state

<P>
The UNKNOWN state has the same meaning as the TerminalConnection's UNKNOWN
state.
</P>

<BR>

<H3>State Transitions for the CallControlTerminalConnection Interface</H3>
<P>
In the overview of the core TerminalConnection states, a finite state machine
described the allowable transitions from one TerminalConnection state to the
other. This state diagram illustrates how TerminalConnections may move from one 
state to an other. The following diagram is the analogous state diagram for the 
CallControlTerminalConnection states.

<BR>

<H3>Relationshiop between TerminalConnection and
CallControlTerminalConnection States</H3>
<P>
In addition to the allowable transitions of TerminalConnection states in the Call Control Package, the mapping of the TerminalConnection states to the
CallControlTerminalConnection states is important. This mapping implies that
when the CallControlConnection state is a certain states, it implies the
TerminalConnection state must be a certain state. Although applications should
only monitor one set of states, it is necessary to provide this mapping to

Control Package (on the right) and the state of the TerminalConnection in the
core package (on the left). Note that applications may obtain the core
TerminalConnection state via the method TerminalConnection.getState() and
applications may obtain the Call Control Package TerminalConnection states via
the CallControlTerminalConnection.getCallControlState() method.

<A NAME="CONNECT">Timeline for Telephone Calls</A>
</H2>


<P>
The Overview document for the core Java Telephony API presented a timeline
diagram of the state transitions for Connections and TerminalConnections in
a likely scenario resulting from a Call.connect() invocation. These diagrams
are the best means to understand the API during different situations. In this
section, a similar diagram is presented describing the outcome of placing
a telephone call in terms of the CallControl states.
</P>
<P>
In the diagram below, time is the vertical axis where time increases going
down the page. The solid vertical lines denote various objects: Call, Terminal,
and Address. The solid horizontal lines between the Call and Address represent
a Connection and the dotted horizontal lines between the Address and Terminal
represent TerminalConnections. Each discrete change in the call model is
denoted by a number along the left-hand side of the page. More than one change
may occur to the call model during a single discrete step; the application
sees these changes as happening all at once.
</P>
<P>
In the scenario below, the originating side has one Terminal associated with
it and the destination side has two Terminals (denoted in the diagram as
'A' and 'B') associated with it. The switch is configured to bridge all
Terminals that are not actively part of a telephone call but share an address
which is active. This scenario shows how a telephone call is placed and
completed to one of the destination Terminals. Then, the second terminal joins
the call using the join() method from this package. Finally, the originator
hangs up his phone and the entire call becomes disconnected.
