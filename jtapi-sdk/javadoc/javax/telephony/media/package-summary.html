<p>The
<!--  JTAPI Media package --> ECTF S.410 API
   defines the MediaService and Resource APIs for utilizing 
   the media streams of calls. 

<!--  JTAPI Media --> The ECTF S.410 API

is suitable for applications doing <i>content</i> processing,
independent of the call setup, signalling and routing.
For example, this API is designed to simplify applications that implement
interactive voice response (IVR) systems,
auto-attendant or <i>robotic</i> agents (versus <i>live</i> operators),
voice mail, speech recognition, text-to-speech, fax, integrated messaging, etc.
</P>

<H1>1. Introduction</H1>

<P>
<!--  JTAPI Media --> The ECTF S.410 API (also called 'JTAPI Media')

is an optional package of the Java Telephony API (JTAPI).
It is related to, and interoperates with, the core JTAPI package and other
JTAPI extension packages.

<!--  JTAPI Media --> The ECTF S.410 API

is a Java language expression of the ECTF media services API
and Architecture. It is related to the ECTF S.100 C language API that
preceded the Java version historically.</P>

<P>The ECTF architecture defines a framework for system services that may be
used by media applications. The ECTF architecture includes services for
managing media resources and calls as well as APIs for directly manipulating
media resources and calls.</P>

<P>The design of JTAPI Media permits applications that are providing a
"media only" service to use high-level, framework-supplied services for call management.
Such applications do not need to use any of the JTAPI core or call control methods.</p>

<p>More complex applications <i>can</i> use the full range of JTAPI core and extension
package APIs. Methods are provided to allow applications to integrate media
services with other JTAPI packages in a smooth and natural manner.</P>

<P>The following subsections explain the ECTF architecture and how it
relates to JTAPI and the JTAPI Media package.</P>

<P><b>Note:</b> This version of JTAPI Media API replaces the Media package
defined in JTAPI-1.2. All classes in the JTAPI-1.2 release of the Media
package were deprecated in the JTAPI-1.3 release. The new media package is
defined to ensure there are no namespace overlaps allowing the coexistence
of both packages for a transition period.</P>

<h2>1.1 The ECTF media service architecture:</h2>

<P>The ECTF architecture allows the separation of media applications and the
services for media processing from the applications and services for call
processing. The ECTF architecture includes many services: </P>

<UL>
<LI>a central broker for shared media processing resources (DSP or otherwise), </LI>
<LI>management of the local switch fabric (to interconnect the media streams of calls and DSP resources), </LI>
<LI>a file storage subsystem (for prompts and recordings), </LI>
<LI>a service to manage call processing (making, answering, and dispatching calls), and </LI>
<LI>other services to manage installation, configuration, registration and administration of hardware and software modules.</LI></UL>

<P>JTAPI Media is compatible with the ECTF architecture, and incorporates
the ECTF concepts of Groups, Resources and the System Call Router. However,
JTAPI Media does not expose all the ECTF architectural components. The
following diagram shows the relationship between the ECTF architecture and
JTAPI/JTAPI Media.</P>

<A NAME="Figure1">
<P ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG SRC="doc-files/Figure1.gif" WIDTH=405 HEIGHT=332>
</P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1</P></B>
</A>

<P>The ECTF architecture defines additional components and interfaces which
may be used when implementing the APIs. 
The ECTF "Architecture Framework Whitepaper" contains additional information. 
It can be downloaded from:
<A HREF="http://www.ectf.org/pages/pubdocs/arch_fr.pdf">
http://www.ectf.org/pages/pubdocs/arch_fr.pdf
</A>
</P>

<h4> Simplifies applications </h4>
<p>
The key feature of this architecture is that detailed call control
and network line signalling can be handled <i>outside</i> of the
media service application.  Which has several benefits:
<ul><li>
Application are smaller, easier to write, media/content developer
is not required to understand network signalling protocols
<li></li>
The choice of networks that are supported, and the effort
to support them is managed in the server/platform.
<li></li>
Applications can run on any network device supported by the server.
<li></li>
Since applications do not write device management or resource sharing,
applications do not create conflicting frameworks to control shared resources.
</li></ul>
</p>
<P>From a media application's point of view, there is one module (an
application or suite of applications) that manages call flow. Shown in the
diagram as the SCR (System Call Router), that module is chartered with
detecting inbound calls, doing call type discrimination, managing call
progress signaling, routing the call to the appropriate destination, and
generally managing the overall life-cycle of the call. That call management
service is developed using the usual techniques for call processing; in
particular, the service may be implemented using JTAPI call control. The
implementation of the call management services may be large/complex or
simple/basic, depending on the requirements of the deployment
environment.</P>

<h4> Applies to large or small systems </h4>
<P>In an enterprise call center, the central call management functionality
is part of the underlying ACD or call center management application;
ultimately calls are directed to agents or queues. In such an environment,
some of the "agents" may be "robotic agents". That is, the queue or terminal
to which a call is directed may be handled by a media service application
implemented using JTAPI Media (or ECTF-S.100). These robotic agents may
query the caller for an account number, or query the caller for the type of
service required, play or record a message, or attempt to entertain/annoy
the caller in some other way.</P>

<P>In a desktop, terminal, or appliance scenario, where multiple
applications or functional modules cooperate to use a single
line/connection, the "central call management functionality" is implemented
by the platform service that manages the line protocol, does call type
discrimination, and routes calls to various modules to process voice, fax or
other types of calls. That is, for a single resource (the telephony device or modem)
to be shared by multiple, independent applications, some platform service
must be responsble for managing the shared resource.
The manager is associated with the nature of the <i>device</i> and owns
and controls its initiation and maintenance, but allows other applications
to provide content or services for that device.
<p>
The manager is the "traffic cop" responsible for routing calls to the
correct service application.
For example, fax calls may be routed to a module that enables the fax modem
and captures the incoming fax in a message store. Data calls may be routed
to a module that configures IP/PPP/HDLC and implements the platform's IP
subsystem. Voice calls may be routed to a module that alerts the user, waits
for a "user gesture" that indicates "answer it, I want to talk", answers
the call, attaches the local speaker and microphone, and waits for further
input from the user. </P>

<h4> Enable independent services to share resources </h4>

<P>The intention of this architecture is to enable each media service (voice
recording, fax transmission, etc.) to be composed independently and then
integrated with the other services. Each service may rely on the fact that
basic call control, call type discrimination, line and resource allocation,
and the flow of calls between applications will be handled by some framework
component outside the application. However, the application may take
explicit control using the other capabilities such as the JTAPI core or
extension packages. The JTAPI <I>MediaService</I> interface defines the
interface between an application and the call and resource management
components of the framework. </P>

<P>Because applications delegate these responsibilities to the framework,
they can easily be integrated into a variety of framework implementations
and with each other. This is similar to the way graphic "component"
applications delegate their size and placement to containing applications or
display managers. If each application is allowed, encouraged or required to
perform these services, conflicts will arise when multiple applications are
integrated.
</P>

<h4> Simple view of "call control" </h4>
<P>In this model, the media service object (either in a terminal or as a
robotic service agent) sees a very narrow view of "call control".
The basic loop is to: </P>

<OL> 
<LI> Signal readiness to handle a call.</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI> wait for a call to be directed to the application.</LI>
 </UL>
<LI> Attach the resources necessary to process the data stream.</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI> modem, voice coders, signal detectors, 
 data communications protocol stacks, etc,</LI>
 </UL>
<LI> Process the call.</LI>
 <UL>
 <LI> send/receive voice, tones, data blocks, etc. </LI>
 <LI> query/update databases  </LI>
 <LI> store/retrieve messages </LI>
 </UL>
<LI> Transfer or release the call.  </LI>
 <UL>
 <LI> with appropriate annotations to indicate the results of the
 interaction.  </LI>
 </UL>
</OL>

<h2>1.2 The JTAPI interfaces and framework:</h2>

<P>In JTAPI Media, the application interacts primarily with the
BasicMediaService class. With reference to <A HREF="#Figure1">Figure&nbsp;1</A>,
the methods of BasicMediaService can be divided into three categories,
reflecting the target of the method:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Bind and Release methods, directed to the System Call Router </LI>
<LI>Generic media group methods, directed to the MediaGroup object </LI>
<LI>Resource specific methods, directed to the Resource object (via the MediaGroup)</LI>
</UL>

<P>The bind and release methods and the generic media group methods are
defined and documented in the MediaService interface. BasicMediaService
extends that to include the interfaces for the defined (<I>standard</I>)
resources. The framework is designed to be extensible, and allows additional
Resources to be added, in which case BasicMediaService can be specialized or
extended to include the additional resource interfaces.</P>

<P>BasicMediaService is defined as a class so that application developers
can directly create or extend the class to define their own service
implementations. As a class, BasicMediaService allows the supplier of a
javax.telephony.media package to easily control access to and the
implementation of any underlying components. For example, many
implementations of the JTAPI Media interfaces want to ensure that resources
are not susceptible to abuse from malicious, failing or merely misinformed
applications. BasicMediaService provides a level of indirection between the
application and the actual implementation classes. Presenting
BasicMediaService as a class and using the <i>bind/release</i> concept to
access media resources also avoids the problems of stale handles or
"dangling references" to MediaGroups or Resources which the application can no
longer use.
</P><P>
The bind and release methods warrant a few definitions and additional
explanation:</P>

<h4> Bind and Release overview</h4>

<P>A <I>MediaTerminal</I> extends the JTAPI Terminal interface indicating
that the Terminal is capable of providing media streams for computer/DSP
processing. The media streams can be connected to various <I>Resources</I>
that generate or consume the stream content. The collection of Resources
attached to a MediaTerminal constitutes a <I>MediaGroup</I> object.</P>
<P>
When a call is directed to a MediaTerminal, the SCR that manages that
Terminal determines which application will initially control that 
MediaTerminal.  The MediaTerminal streams are connected to a MediaGroup
(containing Resources as specified in the application's ConfigSpec),
and that MediaGroup is <i>bound</i> to the application's MediaService object.
<p>
While it is <i>bound</i>, methods invoked on the MediaService are forwarded
to the MediaGroup.
<p>
When the call is directed away from the MediaTerminal (by transfer or disconnect),
the application retains the MediaService object, but it is
<i>released</i> (or unbound) from the MediaGroup.
The framework can immediately reuse the MediaTerminal, the MediaGroup and
any Resources without interference from the previously bound application.
</P>
<P>The JTAPI Media API is mainly concerned with how an application handles
the media processing once the call is connected to a MediaTerminal. The
JTAPI Media API expects and relies on the other JTAPI packages to make
connections to MediaTerminals and otherwise manage the routing of calls.</P>

<h4> Modular components </h4>
<P>The JTAPI Media API is designed to aid and enhance the development of
simple, modular applications that provide media services for telephony
users. This philosophy of modularization makes JTAPI Media well suited as
the basis for creating JavaBeans that represent specific media treatments
for calls. GUI/RAD/IDE developers may create drag-and-drop Beans
representing services as simple as getting a caller's account number, to a
full-scale auto-attendant and voice-mail system.</P>

<A NAME="_Section1_3"><!--  --></A>
<h2>1.3 Creating a new media service</h2>

<P>An application developer can easily create a new service by extending the
class <tt>BasicMediaService</tt> and writing simple, synchronous code to
define the service. As explained above, the details of recognizing a call
and delivering it to the application can be delegated to the framework.
The new media service can then be developed into a JavaBean for easy inclusion
in GUI or RAD application builders.</P>

<A NAME="_Section1_3_1"><!--  --></A>
<h3>1.3.1 <A HREF="doc-files/HelloWorld.java">HelloWorld</A> Example</h3>

<P>For example, this media service receives a call
and plays the contents of the file "Hello": </P>
<PRE>import javax.telephony.media.*;
public class HelloWorld extends BasicMediaService {
    public static void main(String[] argv) {
        new HelloWorld().run();
    }
    /** Wait for calls to be delivered to "HelloWorld",
     *  and say "Hello" to the caller.
     */
    public void run() {
        try {
            bindToServiceName(ConfigSpec.basic, "HelloWorld");
            play("Hello", 0, null, null);
            release();
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            System.err.println(ex);
        }
    }
}</PRE>

<P>Note that since the application extends the BasicMediaService class, all
the media methods are directly available to it. Its <tt>main()</tt> simply creates a
HelloWorld object and calls the <tt>run()</tt> method on it. This method waits for an
incoming call (using <tt>bindToServiceName</tt>), plays a phrase, releases the
MediaGroup and associated Resources, and then returns.</P>

<h1>2. Design Goals of JTAPI Media</h1>

<P>This API and system architecture is designed for multi-vendor
applications and shared resource scenarios in an enterprise
environment. This necessitates certain assumptions, features and services
that are not required for single-user, personal applications.</P>

<P>However, JTAPI Media <I>can</I> be effectively deployed and used on
single-user desktop systems. By moving commonly required features and
services out of the application and into the platform framework, JTAPI Media
allows application development and integration to be correspondingly easier
and more robust. </P>

<P>The major characteristics, assumptions, and design points of the API are
as follows:</P>

<h2>2.1 Managed Telephony Framework</h2>

<P>This API is designed for applications that operate within a managed
framework for call processing. For example, </P>

<UL>
<LI>an enterprise customer service/call center, </LI>
<LI>a dial-up information service provider, </LI>
<LI>a mobile telephony base station, </LI>
<LI>a mobile telephony terminal, </LI>
<LI>a public network "voice dialer", </LI>
<LI>a LAN-Fax server, </LI></UL>

<P>and many others.</P>

<h2>2.2 Centralized Call Management</h2>

<P>The ECTF architecture defines an environment in which call processing is
managed and centralized. In such an environment, media service applications
are written to assume that call processing is delegated to a system service
(the diagram in section 1.1) that handles:</P>

<UL>
<LI>call progress, </LI>
<LI>call-type discrimination, </LI>
<LI>CLID, ANI and DID processing, </LI>
<LI>routing of inbound calls to various applications or agents, </LI>
<LI>making outbound calls, including least-cost routing,
glare detection and resolution, predictive dialing, etc.</LI></UL>

<P>
Note that the "central control" can be as extensive as a million dollar call
canter manager, or as small as a simple scheme to share access to the radio
link of a cell phone.
</P>

<P>In a JTAPI environment, this system service is built on the JTAPI Core
and extension packages.</P>

<h2>2.3 Multi-Vendor Applications</h2>

<P>The client applications may be written/developed by different software
vendors, and integrated into the enterprise/server framework by some
administrative agency. At issue is providing enough of the common framework
components (for resource management and call control) so that all
application vendors do not attempt to create their own (probably
incompatible) frameworks.</P>

<P>Currently, this means that the API encourages a view of application and
system architecture where all applications follow common
conventions/protocols for binding and releasing calls, requesting and
releasing media/DSP resources.</P>

<P>An example is a call routing application that provides the caller an
option to jump to the voice mail application. The voice mail application
might be provided by a different vendor than the site-specific routing
application. Ultimately, the ECTF architecture will ensure (encourage) that
applications look enough alike that they can be installed and managed
homogeneously.</P>

<h2>2.4 Distributed Architecture</h2>

<P>This API is designed to allow distribution of the applications and
implementation across processes and or networks. The implementation may
contain servers that contain and manage the telephony and DSP equipment used
by a plurality of client applications. Therefore, the API is designed to
allow the delegation of transactions and services to the server to avoid
lots of low level network traffic. Fine-grain operations are also possible
and useful for non-distributed applications where network or processor
latencies are not an issue. </P>

<P>The transactions and services are defined to enhance the experience of
the remote/telephonic user, primarily by reducing the latency that would be
otherwise introduced if all events and reactions must transit from the
resource provider/server to the application and back to the server. Such
timing issues are typically <I>not</I> an issue for single user and single
line (desktop) systems, but when scaling to hundreds of lines and multiple
applications it becomes desirable or necessary to download the common user
interaction logic to the server and potentially to the line interface board.</P>

<P>Several examples are as follows:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Prompts for DTMF ("touch tone") input are normally terminated as soon as
the caller presses the first DTMF digit of the input sequence. A delay of
several hundred milliseconds in stopping the prompt playback is a known
caller irritant and may cause the caller to question whether the input was
received successfully. The responsibility to stop the prompt on input can
therefore be delegated to the server to eliminate any network delays. </LI>

<LI>Delivering a collection of phrases to the server to be played as a unit
eliminates any potential delays between the phrases. </LI>

<LI>Using DTMF to change the volume of an ongoing play may be delegated by
the client to the server (and possibly handled by some on-board embedded
processor), resulting in improved system responsiveness and simplified
application code.</LI></OL>

<P>All of this notwithstanding, the client application is empowered to get
all events, and insert itself into the flow of control.</P>

<h2>2.5 Multi-Language Environment</h2>

<P>The client applications may be written/developed in different programming
languages. In particular, a server for JTAPI Media applications may also be
supporting ECTF S.100 C language applications. Furthermore, a Java
application may need to invoke an application for a call that is written in
another API and these applications may need to share data. This requires
that certain data and control structures be represented in a form compatible
with other applications in other languages.</P>

<h2>2.6 Extensible Media Resources</h2>

<P>The set of media Resource interfaces is extensible. Vendors of hardware
or software for processing the media streams of calls may define new types
of resource services. This means the API must be structured to allow server
vendors or component vendors to extend the API. At this time, the Player,
Recorder, SignalDetector, SignalGenerator and ASR are included. We expect the
FAX Resource to be defined in a future release of JTAPI Media.</P> 

<P>Other non-ECTF defined APIs such as the Java Speech and media APIs may be
utilized in the creation of Media Resources and in future these APIs may
become more closely related to JTAPI Media.</P>

<h2>2.7 Asynchronous provider framework</h2>

<P>The internal interactions between a client and its server (behind the
MediaService) are designed to be asynchronous. This reflects the
asynchronous nature of telephony signaling, the realities of network
latencies, and a parsimonious use of state and threads on the client.</P>

<h2>2.8 Synchronous (Blocking) API</h2>

<P>Even though many media servers implement an asynchronous model in the
low-level interfaces, and even in their API, the multithreaded nature of
Java make a synchronous programming model the most natural for the majority
of media applications. A synchronous API is simple, easy to understand, and
easy to use for the majority of applications. In cases where simultaneous
activity must be controlled by the application, threads allow a way to do
this within the synchronous model. </P>

<P>The use of a synchronous media model is generally consistent with the
JTAPI model, where any method can potentially block waiting for activity to
complete or waiting on communication over the network. In JTAPI non-media
packages, only events that are of long and indeterminate delay because they
correspond to user actions or network activity are represented by
asynchronous events. JTAPI Media likewise provides asynchronous events for
these types of events.</P>

<P>The MediaService interface and the BasicMediaService class that
implements that interface therefore present a synchronous interface to the
application. That is, each method/request waits for completion before
returning to the application thread. </P>

<h2>2.9 Asynchronous API</h2>

<P>Some applications and some developers work best with a non-blocking
and/or event driven application model. This may in some cases provide a
greater degree of efficiency and scalability. For those applications and
developers, an asynchronous API is included in JTAPI Media Release-1.4
(S.410 Revision-2). </P>

<h2>2.10 Reference Implementation for Provider implementors</h2>

<P>A significant amount of the API implementation can be common among many
vendors, even though the lower levels of the implementation may vary
radically. JTAPI Media Release-1.4 (ECTF S.410 Revision-2) includes the 
<a href="provider/package-summary.html">
<tt>javax.telephony.media.provider</tt></a> package which implements
most of the JTAPI Media framework.  A Media Provider's Interface (MPI)
is defined to allow platform developers to plug in their own
implementation of the <tt>GroupProvider</tt> and <tt>MediaGroup</tt> objects.
Using the provider package reference implementation ensures that the
basic semantics of binding and event delivery are implemented consistantly
by various MediaService provider impelemtations.
</p><p>
<b>Note:</b> the actual values for Symbols are not exposed to application
developers and are not defined in this specification. However,
for interoperability ECTF defines the complete set of Symbols
for S.410 and S.100.  Provider implementors are advised to get
the current Symbol definitions before deploying a Provider.
</p>
<p>
For further information, potential implementors are advised to contact the
JSR-043 Spec Lead or
the JTAPI Media development community,

<tt>ectf-tgjmedia@ectf.org</tt></a>. 
</P>

<A NAME="_Section3"><!--  --></A>
<h1>3. JTAPI Media interfaces and classes</h1>

<P>JTAPI Media defines classes for communicating information from
application to the server/provider, interfaces for controlling media
resources, an interface for controlling access to calls and their media
streams and an implementation class that provides the basis for simple,
synchronous control of the above interfaces.</P>

<P>The JTAPI Media architecture separates the framework control and
management interfaces from the extensible set of media resource
interfaces. The following overview of the interfaces and classes will first
describe the framework interfaces (how to get access to a call's media
stream, and define the resources or protocols to be used on those streams)

<h2>3.1 Framework Interfaces and classes</h2>

<P>
These <A HREF="package-tree.html">classes and interfaces</A> define the
intrinsic framework of JTAPI Media applications.
</P>
<p>
Section 3.1.1 describes the basic synchronous (or <i>blocking</i>) 
methods for MediaService.

The <a href="async/package-summary.html">async package</a>
defines asynchronous (or <i>non-blocking</i>) versions for all these methods.
The asynchronous programming interface is described in 
<a href="#_Section3_4">Section 3.4</a>.
</p>

<A NAME="_Section3_1_1"><!--  --></A>
<h3>3.1.1 Interface MediaService</h3>

<P>The MediaService interface defines methods for getting access to a call's
media stream. In JTAPI nomenclature, getting access to a media stream is
defined as:<I> binding this MediaService object to a collection of media
processing resources</I>. The resources are associated with a Terminal and
the resources process the media streams of the Connection that is active at
that Terminal. There are several "bind" methods that differ in how they
select the Terminal:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>void bindToServiceName(ConfigSpec configSpec, String serviceName)</tt> <BR>
Wait for a call to be directed to the specified serviceName and then bind this MediaService to a MediaTerminal connected to that Call. </LI>
<LI><tt>void bindAndConnect(ConfigSpec configSpec, String origAddr, String dialDigits)</tt> <BR>
create an out-bound Call to dialDigits, connect it to a MediaTerminal and bind this MediaService to that MediaTerminal. </LI>
<LI><tt>Connection bindToCall(ConfigSpec configSpec, Call call)</tt> <BR>
create a new Connection from an existing Call to some MediaTerminal and bind this MediaService to that MediaTerminal. </LI>
<LI><tt>void bindToTerminal(ConfigSpec configSpec, Terminal terminal)</tt> <BR>
bind this MediaService to the specified Terminal. This provides media access to any Call or Connection active on that Terminal. </LI>
<LI><tt>void bindToTerminalName(ConfigSpec configSpec, String terminalName)</tt><BR>
bind this MediaService to the terminal specified by an implementation-specific terminalName string. This differs from bindToTerminal() in that it may be used where the underlying framework does not support a JTAPI provider or provide access to JTAPI Terminal objects.</LI></UL>

<P>Each of the <I>bind</I> methods includes a ConfigSpec that indicates the <I>initial</I> configuration of resources that the application requires. A call will not be delivered to a MediaService unless the required resources are available. The application can change the configuration using:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>void configure(ConfigSpec configSpec)</tt><BR>
request a new configuration of resources on the stream.</LI></UL>

<P>There are two basic methods for releasing ownership of a call:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>void release()</tt><BR>
Release the binding between this MediaService and the MediaTerminal
to which it is bound, indicating that this MediaService
has no further interest in servicing the call.
The expectation is that some other entity will determine the fate
of the call. If no other MediaService is bound to this MediaTerminal
then the provider implemetation typically disconnects the call
and makes the MediaTerminal available for new calls.
</LI>

<LI><tt>void releaseToService(String disposition, int timeout)</tt><BR>

Release the binding between this MediaService and the MediaTerminal
to which it is bound, with the expectation that the Call and Connection on
that MediaTerminal will be processed by some other MediaService,
as determined by the specified <tt>disposition</tt>.
If no application is available to handle the MediaTerminal
within timeout milliseconds, an Exception is thrown and the current
MediaService continues to own the call.  </LI></UL>
<p>
When <a href="#_Section3_5">Delegation</a> is being used,
other forms of release may be useful:
<ul>
<li>
<tt>void releaseToDestroy()</tt><br>
Release with an indication that the call is or should be disconnected.
</li>
<li>
<tt>void releaseToTag(String returnTag)</tt><br>
The most general form of release, this MediaService is unbound
from the MediaTerminal and control reverts to the previously
bound MediaService that expressed interest in handling the 
specified <tt>returnTag</tt>.
</li>
<li>
<tt>void releaseDelegated()</tt><br>
<b>See:</b>  <a href="Delegation.html#releaseDelegated()">Delegation</a>
</li>
</ul>

<P>A ConfigSpec may allow several alternatives in the configuration of the
MediaGroup: choices of resources and parameters or attributes associated
with the MediaGroup or the various resources. To determine which resources
are <I>actually</I> configured and their current parameter/attribute
settings, one may use:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>ConfigSpec getConfiguration()</tt><BR>
Return a description of the current MediaGroup configuration.</LI></UL>

<P>To directly get or set the parameters of the resources use:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>Dictionary getParameters(Symbol[] parameterSymbols)</tt><BR>
Get the values for the indicated parameters. </LI>
<LI><tt>void setParameters(Dictionary parameterDictionary)</tt><BR>
Set the values for the indicated parameters.</LI></UL>

<P>Applications can access the currently bound Terminal, and thereby
get access to the associated call control objects, such as the JTAPI
TerminalConnection, Connection, and Call objects.</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>String GetTerminalName()</tt><BR>
Return an installation-specific String that identifies the Terminal to which
the MediaService is bound.</LI>

<LI><tt>Terminal getTerminal()</tt><BR>
Return the JTAPI Terminal currently bound to the MediaService, 
<i>if</i> the MediaService is associated with a JTAPI Provider. </LI>
</UL>

<h4>3.1.1.1 Miscellaneous and ancillary MediaService methods:</h4>

<P>For the benefit of applications that cooperate on serial processing of a
call, the MediaGroup object associated with a Terminal may be annotated with
arbitrary information in a "UserDictionary". The framework may also populate
the UserDictionary with various items of interest (CallingNumber,
CalledNumber, etc.) before delivering the call to an application. Methods
are supplied to get/set the values in the UserDictionary:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>Dictionary getUserValues(Symbol[] keys)</tt> </LI>
<LI><tt>void setUserDictionary(Dictionay dictionary)</tt> </LI>
<LI><tt>void setUserValues(Dictionary dictionary)</tt></LI></UL>

<P>When handling Exceptions, it is sometimes useful to determine if the MediaService is still bound:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>boolean isBound()</tt><br>
Returns <tt>true</tt> if this MediaService is bound</LI></UL>

<P>Most MediaService methods are defined as synchronous or blocking methods,
they return when the operation has completed (or throw an Exception if the
operation fails). There are a few miscellaneous methods to allow another
thread to interrupt the synchronous methods:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>void cancelBindRequest()</tt><BR>
cause the outstanding bind or release request on this MediaService to fail, throwing BindCancelledException </LI>
<LI><tt>void stop()</tt><BR>
Stop any media resource methods on this MediaService. </LI>
</UL>


<h3>3.1.2 Interface MediaEvent and Its Descendants</h3>

<P>Events are represented by objects of type MediaEvent which are
implemented by a vendor-supplied class that extends
java.util.EventObject. Each event contains an event ID that defines the
particular event and a MediaService object that is the source of the
event. Specializations of MediaEvent contain additional fields and
associated access methods as defined by the Resource that generates that
event.
<b>Note:</b> the <i>provider</i> package contains reference implementations
of all the events defined for JTAPI Media.</P>

<P>MediaEvents are used in two ways: they indicate the outcome
of a MediaService or Resource method invocation, in which case 
they are referred to as a "transaction completion event"; 
alternatively they indicate some asynchronous user action, 
in which case they are referred to as a "non-transactional event".</P>

<P>Non-transactional events are delivered via the MediaListener interfaces
defined for the MediaService and Resource classes. There are only a few of
these and many applications will find that they do not need these events. 
In some cases, similar information is available from a synchronous completion
event. They are available for those applications that find it necessary or
convenient to use them.</P>

<P>The basic JTAPI Media interface, as represented by BasicMediaService,
presents all MediaService and Resource methods as synchronous/blocking
methods. Therefore, transactional events are delivered as the return value
of each resource method invocation. The completion event contains additional
information about how, when or why the transaction completed. 
If a transaction fails, then an Exception is thrown, and that Exception will
contain information on how, when, why the transaction failed. </P>

<A NAME="_Section3_1_3"><!--  --></A>
<h3>3.1.3 Interface MediaListener and its Descendants</h3>

<P>The JTAPI Media synchronous API defines Listener interfaces for
non-transactional resource events such as Connection disconnected, signal
detected, pattern detected, and RTC actions triggered by the user.</P>

<P>There is one Listener interface for the MediaService events, and
additional listener interfaces for events generated by each resource. 
A listener may have multiple methods, each providing a callback for a
particular event or group of events. 
All of these listener interfaces extend from the MediaListener interface.</P>

<P>The MediaService interface defines <tt>addMediaListener()</tt> and
<tt>removeMediaListener()</tt> methods which add/remove a MediaListener.
The Listener object that is added may implement any or all of the defined
MediaListener interfaces. Each event generated by a BasicMediaService is
dispatched to all the added MediaListeners which implement the Listener
interface for that event. </P>

<P>Listeners may be added to a MediaService before it is bound, and the
listeners are not removed because of binds, releases, or
reconfigurations. If a particular resource is not configured into a
MediaService, then that MediaService does not generate or dispatch the
associated events. Note: most resources include the <tt>p_EnabledEvents</tt>
parameter that controls which events are generated by the resource.</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>void addMediaListener(MediaListener listener)</tt>
<BR>add a listener, which may implement one or more MediaListener interfaces, 
to the MediaService.</LI>
<LI><tt>void removeMediaListener(MediaListener listener)</tt>
<BR>remove a listener from the MediaService</LI></UL>

<P>



Applications using the synchronous MediaService do not need Listeners
to handle Transaction completion events.
Transaction completion events are <I>not</I> sent to Listeners; 
they are returned directly to the invoking method as the return value.
</P>
<P>The Listeners defined for JTAPI Media and the callbacks they define are:</P>
<UL>

<LI>MediaServiceListener
<UL>
<LI><tt>void onDisconnected(MediaEvent event)</tt><BR>
    The Connection to this MediaTerminal is disconnected. </LI>
<LI><tt>void onConnected(MediaEvent event)</tt><BR>
    The Connection to this MediaTerminal is connected. </LI>

<LI><tt>void onIntermediateResultsReady(ASREvent event)</tt> </LI>
</UL>
</LI>

</UL>

<h3>3.1.4 Class MediaException and MediaRuntimeException</h3>

<P>When a media operation fails, an Exception is generated. Applications may
reliably assume that if a synchronous method returns, the operation
completed normally; if there is an error then an Exception is thrown.</P>

<P>Media Exceptions derive from two classes: MediaRuntimeException is the
root for all RuntimeExceptions that are defined for the Media
package. MediaException is the root for the remaining exceptions. Note that
the Java compiler does not require that RuntimeExceptions be declared or
caught within the lexical scope where they are thrown. </P>
<P>MediaException has three subclasses:</P>

<UL>
<LI><tt>MediaServiceException</tt> represents those Exceptions that are
thrown by methods in the MediaService interface. These are the methods that
are not associated with a particular Resource. MediaServiceException has two
subclasses: MediaBindException and MediaConfigException. </LI>

<LI><tt>MediaResourceException</tt> is used for all exceptions thrown by
resource methods. A MediaResourceException contains a ResourceEvent (for
example, a PlayerEvent) that fully describes the failure. The application
uses the ResourceEvent methods to extract the failure cause and other
details. </LI>

<LI><tt>MediaCallException</tt> represents call control exceptions that may
be caught by any of the MediaService methods that do internal call
control. For example, the bindAndConnect method could encounter failures in
the createCall() and connect() methods. A MediaCallException contains a
string description of the exception.</LI></UL>


<h3>3.1.5 Class ConfigSpec and ResourceSpec</h3>

<P>These ConfigSpec and ResourceSpec are "struct" classes that the
application uses to define the resource configuration required. </P>

<P>Each class contains final static members that contain useful pre-defined
configurations. There are predefined ConfigSpecs and ResourceSpecs for
commonly used configurations, and the application can define its own
specifications as well.</P>

<h3>3.1.6 Class RTC </h3>

<P>RTC is a "struct" class for defining Run Time Controls
(Condition-&gt;Action pairs). RTCs effect or control the processing or
termination of a resource method. Several commonly used runtime controls are
pre-defined as static final members of Class RTC. An example is
<tt>RTC.SigDet_StopPlay</tt>, which allows the SignalDetector to stop the
Player when a DTMF digit is detected.</P>

<h3>3.1.7 Class BasicMediaService</h3>

<P>This class implements the MediaService interface methods and all the
standard Resource interfaces. This provides the application a convenient
mechanism to invoke any of the resource methods. BasicMediaService
implements the binding of a MediaGroup and the delegation of resource
methods to the bound MediaGroup.</P>

<P>BasicMediaService is primarily an aggregation of other interfaces, the
only new or interesting methods it supplies are its constructors; the other
methods of BasicMediaService are documented in the MediaService or Resource
interfaces.</P>

<P>This class may be used as a base class and specialized by application
developers, which provides the convenience of referring to its methods
without qualifying them with the BasicMediaService object name.</P>

<A NAME="_Section3_2"><!--  --></a>
<h2>3.2 ECTF Resource interfaces</h2>
<h3>3.2.1 Player</h3>

<P>Play a sequence of pre-recorded media data object (MDO) files.</P>
<P>Numerous Coders are defined and a Player can switch coders for each MDO
as necessary. The Player includes options for pause and resume, changing
volume or speed, and jumping forward or backward within the stream.</P>
<p>
<ul>Basic method:
<li>
<tt>play(String streamID, int offset, RTC[] rtcs, Dictionary optargs);</tt>
</li></ul>
</p>

<h3>3.2.2 Recorder</h3>

<P>Records to an MDO file. </P>
<P>Numerous Coders are defined. The Recorder includes options for pausing and resuming, playing an initial beep, and silence suppression.</P>
<p>
<ul>Basic method:
<li><tt>record(String streamID, RTC[] rtcs, Dictionary optargs);</tt></li></ul>
</p>

<h3>3.2.3 SignalGenerator</h3>

<P>Generates and sends DTMF (and possibly other) signals.</P>
<p>
<ul>Basic methods:
<li><tt>sendSignals(String signals, RTC[] rtcs, Dictionary optargs);</tt></li>
<li><tt>sendSignals(Symbol[] signals, RTC[] rtcs, Dictionary optargs);</tt></li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>3.2.4 SignalDetector</h3>

<P>Detects DTMF signals and application defined patterns of
signals. Detected signals and patterns can use used to control other
(play and record) operations using RTCs (run time controls).</P>
<p>
<ul>Basic method:
<li>
<tt>retrieveSignals(int numSignals, Symbol[] patterns, RTC[] rtcs, Dictionary optargs);</tt>
</li></ul>
</p>

<h3>3.2.5 ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)</h3>
<P>
Recognizes spoken words in both discreet and continuous speech.
</P>
<p>
<ul>Basic method:
<li><tt>recognize(RTC[] rtcs, Dictionary optargs);</tt></li></ul>
</p>

<h3>3.2.6 TTS (Text To Speech)</h3>

<P>The TTS interface is an extension of the Player resource, 
because TTS is considered as a <i>coder</i> in which speech
is encoded as text. The additional methods for TTS are used
to load and activate particular pronounciation dictionaries.
</P>
<ul>Basic methods:
<li><tt>loadTTSDictionary(String[] dictNames, Dictionary optargs)</tt></li>
<li><tt>activateTTSDictionary(String[] dictNames, Dictionary optargs)</tt></li>
<li><tt>deactivateTTSDictionary(String dictNames[], Dictionary optargs)</tt></li>
<li><tt>unloadTTSDictionary(String dictNames[], Dictionary optargs)</tt></li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2.7 FAX</h3>

<P>A resource to send and receive FAXes. 
This is not included in the current JTAPI Media release (due to release timing), 
but is defined by ECTF and is expected in the next release of JTAPI Media.
Expect simple methods for <tt>faxSend(String MDO)</tt> and <tt>faxReceive(String MDO)</tt>.
</P>

<h3>3.2.8 Conference Resource</h3>
<p>
In most cases, conference creation can be managed by an associated
call control API.  If the media package is used to <i>implement</i>
the conferencing function inside the call control platform then
the application needs to use a conference Resource directly.
The MediaConnection interface can be used to connect between a
MediaService with a CPR (Conference Port Resource) and other MediaServices.
To configure a Conference Resource into a MediaService, the ConfigSpec
should use <tt>ESymbol.CPR_ResourceClass</tt> and associated signals.</p>
<p>
In this version of the media package there is no API (no <i>methods</i>)
for the conference resource, but some parameters and attributes are defined
for CPR in the ECTF framework. 
As with Fax, expect this to be more easily accessible in the next release.
</p>

<h3>3.2.9 Data modem</h3>

<P>A data communications or modem resource has not been specified by ECTF.
When a modem resource is configured to a stream, the data communications are
managed by the platform's internal data communications framework, for
example, the IP subsystem, or RAS subsystem. Therefore a "modem resource"
interface may exist as way to associate a Terminal with the data
communications framework, but would not have any interesting methods. </P>

<h2>3.3 Naming Conventions for Symbols and Constants</h2>

<P>JTAPI Media defines a large number of constants for events, parameters,
attributes, and so on. 
A naming convention for Symbol fields allows developers to easily
recognize how a particular constant or Symbol is used.
Each resource interface or other class that defines a significant
number of constant Symbols inherits those definitions from its
<I>Resource</I>Constants interface. This allows several interfaces to share
the same constants, makes it easy to reference the constants, and ensures
that the method definitions are not lost in the documentation of the
constants.</P>

<P>Constants have a prefix that identifies their usage as follows:</P>
<table border="1" cellpadding="3">
<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">Prefix:</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>refers to:</TD>

<TR><TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P ALIGN="RIGHT">rtca_</TD>
<TD VALIGN="TOP">
<P>RTC actions (actions that can be triggered by a Run Time Control)</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>Because each Resource extends its <I>Resource</I>Constants interface, it
is easy to reference a constant as a field of that interface, or any
instance of that interface. This code snippet shows an example:</P>
<P>
<pre>
    PlayerEvent pev = play("phrase", null, null, null);
    if (pev.getQualifier() == pev.q_RTC) {
        if (pev.getRTCTrigger() == SignalDetector.rtcc_SignalDetected)
</pre>
<P>Here the qualifier in a PlayerEvent (returned by the play method)
is compared to the constant <tt>q_RTC</tt> 
(a particular qualifier that indicates a method was terminated by a RTC). 
The constant <tt>q_RTC</tt> is defined in the ResourceConstants interface, 
which is extended by ResourceEvent, which is extended by PlayerEvent. 
Thus it can be referenced as <tt>pev.q_RTC</tt>,
<tt>PlayerEvent.q_RTC</tt>, <tt>ResourceEvent.q_RTC</tt>, 
or <tt>ResourceConstants.q_RTC</tt>.
</P>

<A NAME="_Section3_4"><!--  --></a>
<h2>3.4 Asynchronous Interface Package</h2>

The <a href="async/package-summary.html">
<tt>javax.telephony.media.async</tt></a> package defines interfaces with
methods, events and listeners for asynchronous (non-blocking) operations.
</p><p>
The asynchronous method definitions are derived directly from
the synchronous method definitions. 
For each synchronous method, the asynchronous method is 
prepended with "<tt>async_</tt>" 
and has exactly the same argument list.
That is:
<ul><li>
<tt>SomeReturnType methodName(arglist)</tt> becomes
</li><li>
<tt>Async.Event async_methodName(arglist)</tt>
</li></ul>
</p><p>
The return type from an asynchronous method is some <tt>Async.Event</tt>, 
specialized as necessary to contain any return values.
<tt>Async.Event</tt> extends the basic MediaEvent, 
adding a few methods for synchronization:
<ul>
<li><tt>boolean isDone();            // checks if this event is done</tt></li>
<li><tt>void waitForEventDone();     // wait until this event is done</tt></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The synchronous MediaService methods described 
(in Sections <a href="#_Section3_1_1">3.1</a> and <a href="#_Section3_2">3.2</a>)
<i>block</i> waiting until the Async.Event is done.  
An event <i>is done</i> when the transaction is complete and the 
return values from the operation have been stored in the event.  
When the event is done, the synchronous MediaService methods
return the value of interest as extracted from the event 
(or return <tt>void</tt>, if there is no interesting value).
The synchronous Resource methods return the event itself;
the event acts like a multiple-value return structure.
</p><p>
In contrast, asychronous methods immediately and directly 
return the <tt>Async.Event</tt> object. The application has limited access 
to the fields of the event until the event is done.  Two event 
fields from MediaEvent are always (or immediately) accessible: 
the EventID and the Event source (a MediaService). 
The methods <tt>getEventID()</tt> and <tt>getSource()</tt> 
(or the equivalent <tt>getMediaService()</tt>) return these values.
The other fields of an event are not accessible until the event
is done.   
</p><p>
An application can synchronize with an event (wait for it to be done)
in four ways:
<ol>
<li>Invoke the <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> method directly. 
    The <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> method blocks until the event is done, 
    and then returns. <br>
    [the invoking Thread is blocked using <tt>Thread.wait()</tt> and is
     released by <tt>notifyAll()</tt> when the event is done.]</li>
<li>Invoke an event accessor 
    (other than <tt>getEventID</tt> or <tt>getMediaService</tt>).
    All event accessors internally call <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> before
    extracting values from the event.</li>
<li>Invoke the event method <tt>isDone()</tt> to effect a "polling" test.
    <tt>isDone()</tt> returns <tt>false</tt> if <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> 
    would block. <br>
    [internally <tt>waitForEventDone()</tt> blocks until <tt>isDone()</tt>
     returns <tt>true</tt>.]</li>
<li>Establish a Listener for the event of interest. 
    The listener callback is invoked when the event is done.</li>
</ol>
Note that synchronous tranasction methods generate and use asynchronous
events internally, and those events are <i>also</i> delivered to the listeners.
Note also that the event objects returned from synchronous Resource
methods are guaranteed to be <i>done</i> when the method returns.
Furthermore, the synchronous API guarantees that all listeners
have been notified before the method returns.
Internally, the synchronous methods call <tt>waitForListenersDone()</tt>,
which waits until the event is done, and the Listeners have run.
<ul>
<li><tt>void waitForListenersDone(); // wait until event and Listeners are done</tt></li>
</ul>
</p><p>
As always, the order in which listeners are invoked is indeterminate.
</p>
<h3>3.4.1 Interface Async.MediaService</h3>
<a href="#_Section3_1">Section 3.1</a> describes 
the basic MediaService methods in the simple synchronous API.  
The asynchronous MediaService method definitions are derived from
the synchronous method definitions as described <a href="#_Section3_4">above</a>. 
<p>
Tranaction completion events are delivered 
to an <tt>Async.BindAndReleaseListener</tt> (for Bind and Release methods) or 
to an <tt>Async.MediaGroupListener</tt> (for the MediaGroup methods).
</P>
<h3>3.4.2 Asynchronous Resource Interfaces</h3>
<p>
Each Resource has an asynchronous interface, named Async_<i>Resource</i>.
For example, the asynchronous interface for the <tt>Player</tt> resource
is named <tt>Async_Player</tt>.
</p><p>
Asynchronous Resource methods are named as above.
The method signatures are identical.
The return types are <tt>Async_<i>Resource</i>Event</tt>.
For example, 
<ul><li>
<tt>PlayerEvent play(...)</tt> becomes
</li><li>
<tt>Async_PlayerEvent async_play(...)</tt> 
</li></ul>
</p><p>
If there is an error, then <tt>event.getError()</tt> is non-null.
Transactional Exceptions are stored in the Async.Event, not thrown.
The Exception points back to the ResourceEvent:
<tt>resourceEvent.getException().getResourceEvent()</tt> 
returns a <tt>resourceEvent</tt> that describes the cause of the
error: <tt>getError()</tt>.
</p><p>
Completion events are delivered to Async_<i>Resource</i>Listener.
The callback method in the asychronous Listener 
for the completion of a resource <i>methodName</i>
is typically are named <tt>on<i>MethodName</i>Done</tt>.
For example, when <tt>Player.play(...)</tt> completes, the event 
is delivered to <tt>onPlayDone(PlayerEvent event)</tt>

<h2>3.5 Delegation Interface</h2>
<p>
The <a href="Delegation.html">
Delegation</a> interface allows an application to pass control 
of the media processing to another MediaService and then regain control.
<p>
The Delegation interface is <i>optional</i>.
Application or development tools extend BasicMediaService 
to include and implement the methods of the Delegation interface.
</p><p>
<ul>Basic methods: <li>
<tt>delegateToService(String serviceName, int timeout, String catchTags);</tt>
</li> <li>
<tt>releaseToTag(String returnTag)</tt>
</li></ul>

<tt>delegateToService(...)</tt> gives control of
a MediaGroup to another media service. 
The original owner can simply wait for the MediaGroup to be returned
(the normal completion of <tt>delegateToService()</tt>)
or can unilaterally <tt>retrieve()</tt> the MediaGroup.
</p><p>
<tt>releaseToTag(String returnTag)</tt> returns the MediaGroup from the
this media service to [one of] the previous owner.
</p><p>
The Delegation interface follows the conventions for the Bind and Release
methods of the MediaService interface. Asynchronous methods, events,
and listeners follow the same conventions.
</p>

<h1>4. Relationship to other APIs</h1>
<h2>4.1 Relationship to JTAPI</h2>

<p>JTAPI Media defines a MediaServices API that is largely independent
of the Call objects and call control events defined in the core JTAPI.
Indeed, JTAPI Media applications <i>can</i> be written without 
using the rest of JTAPI. However, JTAPI Media is written to
strongly integrate with JTAPI when both are available from a 
platform provider. </p>
<p>From the JTAPI point of view, the media package is an optional package 
that extends the capabilities of the Provider, Call, and Terminal
to enable applications to write portable and cooperative applications
for handling the media content of JTAPI Calls and Connections.

<p>
Developers who are intimately familiar with JTAPI core and call control 
will find that some conventions are different within the Media package:
</p>
<h4>Model differences in the Media package</h4>
The media package differs from other JTAPI and JTAPI extension packages:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>JTAPI Media defines a set of interfaces that are orthogonal to the Call
and call control objects in the JTAPI core. Previous JTAPI extensions
focused on call control and naturally extended the core objects; JTAPI media
breaks new ground, with new objects to address the needs of media
applications. </LI>

<LI>JTAPI Media uses the Listener interface for events rather than the
Observer interface used by JTAPI-1.2. 
In JTAPI-1.3 the JTAPI core also uses Event Listeners, 
and JTAPI-1.4 extends that pattern to the other package.
It is expected that the next major release of JTAPI
(JTAPI-2.0) will support only the Listener pattern. 
</LI>

<LI>The capabilities mechanism is not used in JTAPI Media. 
Instead, Resource interfaces are considered as solid contracts. If a
component declares that it implements Player, then it is expected to
implement Player. The resource interfaces are therefore defined to include
the common, minimum functionality. Where there are standard extensions to
that functionality, these are represented as "feature set" and identified
and selected using attributes during the configuration process. For resource
extensions that are not covered by the standards, as well as new types of
resources, JTAPI Media is easily extended to include new Resource interfaces.
</LI></UL>

<h4> Style/Pattern differences in the Media package</h4>
<P>There are also several stylistic differences from core JTAPI that are
based on JTAPI Media's ties to S.100 and to that fact that it addresses a
different domain than the call control portions of the API.</P>

<UL>
<LI>Constant names: The names of various constants contain a prefix (a_,
ev_, p_, etc.) to identify their usage. The public fields of all JTAPI Media
objects and interfaces are final static constants, the truly "variable"
fields are accessed by get/set methods. All the field names listed in the
Javadoc produced manual pages are constants. </LI>

<LI>Event packages: Event interfaces are defined in the same package as the
associated object or resource, rather than in a sub-package as done in the
JTAPI packages that use the Observer model. The EventListener model requires
only a few distinct event classes, so the motivation to create a package and
directory for events is not relevant. </LI>

<LI>Event Hierarchy: JTAPI Media uses an event hierarchy similar to Core
JTAPI. The root of the JTAPI Media event hierarchy (<tt>MediaEvent</tt>) does not,
however, extend the JTAPI <tt>event.Ev</tt> interface.  This is because the
EventListener model (used by the Media package) expect Events to extend from
<tt>java.util.EventObject</tt>. </LI>

<LI>Interfaces vs. classes: The JTAPI core API defines most of the
functionality in terms of pure interfaces that are implemented by the
JtapiPeer vendor. The only classes defined are the JtapiPeerFactory and the
Exception classes (Java requires that exceptions be concrete classes
extended from <tt>java.lang.Exception</tt>). JTAPI Media follows the same
basic approach, but supplies additional class implementations. Three such
classes (<tt>ConfigSpec</tt>, <tt>ResourceSpec</tt>, <tt>RTC</tt>) define
additional datatypes used to communicate between the application and the
service provider. The classes provide structured objects, instead of relying
solely on the Java primitive types or util classes. The other class defined
in JTAPI Media is <tt>BasicMediaService</tt>, which provides a base class which
applications may extend for creating and using the MediaService
interface. This base class ensures that applications use a common internal
interface to communicate with vendor supplied implementation objects, and
allows the bind/release/handoff operations to work correctly. </LI>

<LI>Class code, javax deployment, and reference implementations: 
JTAPI Media, the API, is defined by the Javadoc generated specification. 
The <tt>'provider'</tt> package is a reference implementation of JTAPI Media
with an open interface (the MPI) to map to particular platforms.
Given the realities of creating and 
shipping a javax extension package, these files are obviously only 
advisory in nature, but using the provider package implementation
encourages consistency in the interpretation and implementation of the API.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>JTAPI Media is defined to work with the JTAPI core package and is
published as part of JTAPI. The JTAPI Media usage of the EventListener
model is compatible with the Listener usage in JTAPI. </P>

<P>JTAPI Media does not to duplicate the call control functionality of
JTAPI, but there are a few cases where the functionality required for a
media application necessitates providing a "higher level" interface to call
control functionality. These cases are as follows:</P>

<UL>
<LI>It is generally desirable that the development of an application and the
administration of it are handled separately. For example, the system
administrator, not the application developer, makes the determination of
what criteria (ANI, DNIS, port, etc.) are used to select the application to
be run. This is done in the ECTF architecture by defining a system call
routing service, driven by administrative data, that routes an incoming call
to a particular application. To allow calls to be handled by one application
and then <I>handed off</I> to another independent application, the system
call router generally gives the call to an application already answered, and
handles the disposition of an active call. It determines whether the call
should be transferred to another application (or agent or queue or
extension) or disconnected. Thus a typical IVR application does not need to
listen for calls on particular ports, deal with DNIS and ANI, or answer or
hang up the calls. Of course, an application can always use the full range
of JTAPI functionality if it needs to supersede, extend or implement the
call-processing framework. </LI>

<LI>One of the challenges of originating outgoing calls in a
multi-application environment is to properly handle the race condition that
occurs when an application or system seizes a 2-way facility for an outgoing
call just as an incoming call arrives. When the system recognizes this
glare, it must back off and handle the incoming call, and retry another
facility for the outgoing call. This is best done by a system-wide function
that has a view of all the possible applications. To address this, JTAPI
Media provides a "bindAndConnect" method that deals with these issues. This
method is so named because it incorporates the functionality of
Call.connect().</LI></UL>


<h3>4.1.1 Using JTAPI Call Control capabilities with JTAPI Media</h3>

<P>Many media service applications can define their functionality by using
and extending the BasicMediaService class, and allowing the underlying
implementation to manage the creation of Calls and Connections and the
assignment of Terminals. However, the JTAPI Media <B><I>bind</I></B> methods
(described in <A HREF="#_Section3_1_1">3.1.1 Interface MediaService</A>)
allow an application to get a Call or Terminal instance using JTAPI directly
and then bind to that Call or Terminal.</P> <P>No matter which bind method
was used, the media service application can access the underlying JTAPI call
objects using the MediaService getTerminal() method. From the Terminal, the
application can access the other associated call control objects, and use
the associated JTAPI methods to monitor or manipulate the call.</P>

<h3>4.1.2 Example using JTAPI and JTAPI Media</h3>

<P><A HREF="#_Section5_2">Section 5.2 FollowMe:</A> presents a JTAPI Media
application that does detailed or complex call control. The application is a
"find me" application; when an incoming call is delivered to it, the
application tries to reach the desired party, and then if successful,
connects the two parties. </P>

<h2>4.2 Relationship to ECTF</h2>
<h3>4.2.1 S.100</h3>

<P>As a Java language expression of the ECTF architecture, JTAPI Media
closely parallels the functionality provided by the C- language ECTF S.100
API. Since it is imbedded in JTAPI, which provides mechanisms for
conferencing, switching and configuration of network resources, JTAPI Media
does not include some of the S.100 resources that provide this
functionality. Support for some other S.100 resources (e.g. FAX) is not
provided in the current release of JTAPI, but can be handled by vendor
extensions and is expected to be added in a subsequent release.</P>

<h3>4.2.2 Basis for ECTF Media Object Model (S.400).</h3>

<P>The ECTF has a goal of defining a objected-oriented specification
referred to as S.400, that is independent of the particular language and
call control interface. JTAPI Media lays the groundwork for this
effort. That specification, though separate from JTAPI Media, will draw
heavily from the JTAPI Media work and the two specifications are expected to
be compatible.</P>

<h2>4.3 Relationship to CSTA</h2>

<P>The JTAPI is generally modeled after and consistent with ECMA's CSTA
specification for CTI services. The CSTA <i>AttachMedia</i> functionality,
used to associate media resources with a call, is implemented in the JTAPI
Media <tt>bindToCall()</tt> method.</P>

<P>The Desktop CSTA example application (see: <A HREF="#_Section5_3">Section
5.3 InCall:</A>) illustrates how the Incall sample from JTAPI Core is
modified to automatically add a Recorder resource that will record both
sides of the conversation when the call is answered.</P>

<h1>5. Example Applications</h1>

calls and handing them off to other applications, and of course playing,
detecting digits, etc.</P>

<A NAME="_Section5_3"><!--  --></a>
<h2>5.3 <A HREF="doc-files/InCall.java">InCall</A>: Attach a media service
to an existing Call</h2>

<P>This is a simple extension of the JTAPI InCall example. This application
demonstrates how to record a call that is not otherwise involved with IVR.</P>
